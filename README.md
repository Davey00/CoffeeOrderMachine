# CoffeeOrderMachine
The Coffee Order Machine project is a full-stack application designed to allow users to place coffee orders through an interactive web interface. The system is built with a combination of Java for backend processing, SQL for database management, and HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript for front-end development.

The application simulates a real-world coffee ordering system where users can select from various coffee types, customize their orders (e.g., choosing size, adding sugar or milk), and view the total price in real-time. Once an order is placed, the system stores the order details in a relational database, allowing for order tracking and history retrieval.

Key Features:
User-Friendly Interface: A clean and responsive front-end interface built with HTML5 and CSS3, allowing users to easily navigate the coffee ordering process.
Real-Time Price Calculation: JavaScript dynamically updates the total cost based on user selections without reloading the page.
Customizable Orders: Users can choose different coffee types, sizes, and add-ons, giving them complete control over their order.
Database Integration: SQL is used to manage customer data, coffee options, and order history. The system can handle multiple orders and retrieve data efficiently.
Order Management: Java handles the core order processing logic, ensuring that orders are stored and managed effectively.
Technologies Used:
Java: Backend logic for processing orders and managing interactions with the database.
SQL (MySQL): Relational database to store and retrieve order details, customer information, and coffee menu options.
HTML5 & CSS3: Structure and style the web interface, ensuring a modern and responsive design.
JavaScript: Enhances interactivity, handles form validation, and updates the UI dynamically.
Maven: Used for project management, dependency handling, and build automation.
Objectives:
The main objective of the Coffee Order Machine project is to demonstrate the ability to integrate front-end and back-end technologies into a cohesive system. This project showcases proficiency in object-oriented programming, database management, and web development, making it a well-rounded example of a full-stack application.
